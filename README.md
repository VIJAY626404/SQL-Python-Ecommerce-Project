## 📝 Overview

Welcome to the E-commerce Data Analysis Project! This project aims to deliver an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using the power of SQL and Python. By extracting, cleaning, transforming, and loading data into a MySQL database, we provide actionable insights through comprehensive data visualization.

## 📂 Project Files

- **[`Ecommerce Data Analysis Project.pdf`]**: A detailed presentation covering the project's goals, methodologies, and findings.
- **[`Python+Sql_ecommerce.ipynb`]**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis workflow, from data extraction to visualization.
- **[`csv to sql.py`]**: A Python script for converting CSV data to SQL and populating the MySQL database.
- **[`README.md`]**: This very document, providing an overview and guide for the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- **Python 3.x**
- **MySQL**
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/VIJAY626404/SQL-Python-Ecommerce-Project.git]
   cd [SQL-Python-Ecommerce-Project]
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies**
```bash
    python -m venv env
     `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Set up the MySQL database**:
- Use the script csv to sql.py to load the data from CSV files into your MySQL database.

# Running the Analysis
## 1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
    jupyter notebook
```
## 2. Open Python+Sql_ecommerce.ipynb
