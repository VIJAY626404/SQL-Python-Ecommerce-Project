Welcome to the Pizzahut Sales Analysis project! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using SQL, offering insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and more.

## üìÇ Project Files

- **`Sql Queries`**: Contains SQL scripts used for data analysis.
- **`pizza_sales/pizza_sales`**: Directory with SQL files and data relevant to the project.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git attributes file.
- **`Pizzahut Sql Project.pdf`**: Detailed presentation and analysis results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used

- **MySQL**: The relational database management system used for querying and analyzing sales data.

## üìä Method and Functions

- **`JOIN()`**: To combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns.
- **`GROUP BY()`**: To aggregate data into summary statistics.
- **`ORDER BY()`**: To sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
- **`SUM()`**: To calculate the total revenue and quantities.
- **`AVG()`**: To compute average values, such as the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- **`WINDOW FUNCTION()`**: To perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row.
